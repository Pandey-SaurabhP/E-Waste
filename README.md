SIH internal hackathon repository

Use **landing.html** to start the website.

**Implementation Approach:**

1.	Facility Locator: We will use Bing API to locate nearby e-waste facilities and provide Google Maps links.
2.	User Registration: The website will allow users to create profiles and input their e-waste devices for credit calculation.
3.	Incentive System: We will also create a virtual credit system for users to earn and redeem credits for recycling. The users can redeem their credit points and buy items like earphones , powerbank etc.  
4.	Profile Dashboard: We have designed user-friendly profiles to track recycling efforts, credits, and incentives.
5.	Educational Content: Share the benefits of proper e-waste recycling through engaging articles, videos, and infographics.
